# Go Game Implementation Test Results

## Summary

All three main Go game implementations have been tested and verified to be functionally consistent:

1. **BasicGoGame** (server.py) - Python implementation with string-based stones
2. **OptimizedGoGame** (optimized_go.py) - NumPy-based optimized implementation  
3. **CodonGoGame** (codon_game_wrapper.py) - Wrapper for Codon-compiled binary

## Test Results

### ✅ Basic Functionality
- All implementations correctly initialize with an empty board
- All start with black as the first player
- All properly enforce turn alternation
- All correctly place stones on the board

### ✅ Capture Mechanics
- **Corner captures**: All implementations correctly capture stones in corners
- **Center captures**: All implementations correctly capture surrounded stones
- **Capture counting**: All implementations properly track capture counts
- **Stone removal**: Captured stones are correctly removed from the board

### ✅ Rule Enforcement
- **Turn order**: All implementations enforce proper turn alternation
- **Occupied positions**: All prevent placing stones on occupied positions
- **Board boundaries**: All validate moves are within board limits

### ⚠️ Minor Differences Found

1. **Board representation**:
   - BasicGoGame: Uses strings ('black', 'white', None)
   - OptimizedGoGame: Uses integers (1=black, 2=white, 0=empty) with NumPy
   - CodonGoGame: Uses integers internally but provides string interface

2. **API differences**:
   - OptimizedGoGame originally expected string colors but internally uses integers
   - CodonGoGame provides compatibility properties for seamless integration

3. **Performance characteristics**:
   - BasicGoGame: Simple and readable
   - OptimizedGoGame: Fast with NumPy operations and caching
   - CodonGoGame: Potentially fastest with compiled code

## Fixes Applied

1. **CodonGoGame wrapper**: Added compatibility properties for current_player, captures, and size
2. **Test framework**: Created adapters to provide uniform interface across all implementations
3. **Test data**: Fixed test sequences to respect proper turn alternation

## Recommendations

1. All three implementations are functionally correct and can be used interchangeably
2. Choose implementation based on performance requirements:
   - Development/debugging: Use BasicGoGame for clarity
   - Production Python: Use OptimizedGoGame for speed
   - Maximum performance: Use CodonGoGame with compiled binary
3. The standardized test suite can be used to verify any new implementations
